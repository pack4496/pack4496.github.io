To be a Cub Scout leader, adults must go through a criminal background check and have completed a Youth Protection Training course. Our Pack also asks that our adult leaders complete training certification by the Boy Scouts of America, signifying completion of four separate training sessions designed to make them better leaders for the boys in the Pack. Leaders who complete this cycle wear the Trained patch.
