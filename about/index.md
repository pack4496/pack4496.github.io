Welcome to Pack 4496, the oldest Cub Scout Pack on Bainbridge Island, in existence for over 60 years.

Like all Packs, we're a parent-run organization dedicated to giving our kids a combination of fun and educational experiences that help instill the values of Scouting and exemplify the Cub Scout Motto, "Do Your Best."

Whether we're camping as families, designing and racing Pinewood Derby cars, introducing kids to rock climbing at Island Rock Gym, learning to safely participate in archery and BB gun shooting at Summer Camp, or any of our dozens of other activities, the kids in our Pack are always learning and having fun.

We currently have nearly 50 Scouts as part of our Pack and are always looking to add more kids to our group.

All Packs throughout the country are sponsored by a Chartered Organization, usually a church or school interested in helping youth in their communities. Pack 4496's Chartered Organization is Rolling Bay Presbyterian Church (located across from Bay Hay & Feed), where we hold some of our Pack meetings. We are not affiliated with the church beyond our chartered status and our membership comes from many different faiths and a diverse set of family structures. We are inclusive of all who want to participate in Scouting.

Our Pack generally meets once a month, sometimes at Rolling Bay, sometimes at Camp Yeomalt and other times at places like the Bainbridge Island Aquatics Center or Island Rock Gym for some great Scout adventures. 


Six Dens, which are age- or grade-specific groups of kids, make up the Pack. There are one Tiger, one Wolf, two Bear and two Webelos Dens, which you can find out more about in the Ranks section of this site. Dens generally meet at least twice a month to work on small group activities and to help the boys check off their requirements and electives to help them advance through the Scouting program.


By clicking around on this site, you'll find out more about our Pack and the kind of activities we do, Cub Scouting in general, ranks and advancement for the boys, adult leader involvement and more.

If you have questions or would like to talk to someone about visiting one of our meetings or events to see if our Pack would be a good fit for your son, please visit the Contact Us page so we can get in touch. We look forward to hearing from you.
