The fun never stops at Pack 4496. Throughout the school year - and over the summer, but to a lesser degree - our Cub Scouts get to participate in dozens of fun activities as part of our Pack. Here are a few of the favorites:

### Family Camp
We start off each year with a fun overnighter to Fay Bainbridge Park, where we camp, eat and play. Its a great way for the Scouts and parents to meet up and get to know their Dens.

### Pumpkin Not-So-Carving

Scouts enjoyed carving pumpkins in 2015 at Bainbridge Garderns for their annual benefit Halloween Pumpkin Walk benefitting the Boys & Girls Club of Bainbridge Island.

### Rock Climbing

Every couple of years, the boys visit Island Rock Gym. This indoor climbing facility helps give kids a great introduction to rock climbing in a safe, controlled environment. This is one of the highlights of the year.

### Genius Project
The Genius Project is always a fun time. Each Scout is given a bag of identical supplies, including a piece of wood, some cloth, nails, beads, a balloon, pipe cleaners and more. The boys all use their imaginations to create the most ingenious thing they can think of. Then, at our "unveiling" Pack meeting, the boys vote on their favorite. It's a great way for kids to show their creativity.

### Model Rocket Launching
A Spring favorite among Scouts, they build their own rockets (using kits available at hobby and toy stores), strap on the engines and watch 'em fly up, up (and hopefully not away) at Battle Point Park. The kids love running out into the fields to try to catch the rockets as they fall back down to earth on their parachutes.



### Pinewood Derby ###

A Cub Scout classic, this annual event pits Scout against Scout to see whose car crosses the finish line first. All cars start as the same block of wood and through hard work, the Scouts cut, sand and paint their transformation into racing machines. We pair up with another Pack on the island and use a track with laser targeting and pinpoint accuracy to determine our winner through a series of heats and final rounds. May the best car win! 

### Camp Edward Summer Camp ###

Whether it's Day Camp, Resident Camp, Mom & Me Camp, Webelos Woods or Webelos Overnight, our kids have a great time participating in camp activities - archery, BB gun shooting, cooking, swimming, rowing and more.
