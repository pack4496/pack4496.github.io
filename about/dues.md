Pack 4496 dues are $95 per year. This helps cover some of the costs of Pack activities and awards. Of the $95, $24 is sent to the Boy Scouts of America to help fund national, Council and District operations. Scouts also receive a monthly magazine, Boys Life, as part of their dues.

<h2>Boys Life</h2>
Part of your Pack dues cover an annual subscription to Boys' Life magazine, which is published monthly. It is a favorite, and typically the first subscription a young boy ever recieves and is a fond memory for most scouters. Its full of stories, life lessons and good examples for your boys to follow.

<h2>Scouterships</h2>
At Pack 4496, we want to extend the benefits of an enriching Cub Scout experience to everyone. As such, we offer "Scoutership" assistance to families in need of help to offset the cost of annual Pack dues. For more information on this, please contact our Cubmaster (see the Contact Us page).
