Have a Kindergarten-aged boy? Now is a great time to think about joining Cub Scouting. For boys in grades 1-4, Cub Scouting offers a great avenue for learning how to respect others, experience the outdoors, what citizenships means and much, much more. 

Registration for the 2016-2017 Scout year begins on June 12 at our annual Crossover Picnic. Come see this year's Scouts crossover into their new ranks and be awarded the achievements they have worked on over the course of this year.

You can also come to our [Carnival & Open House](), which will be held on May 21, where you can see Scouts in action, and meet Pack leaders who are on hand to answer any questions you might have.

See you in Scouting!
