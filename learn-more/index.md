<h2>Cub Scouting, Your Son and You</h2>
As a parent, you want your son to grow up to be a person of worth; a self-reliant, dependable and caring individual. Scouting has these same goals in mind for him.

Since 1910, Cub Scouts has been weaving values to live by into fun and educational activities designed to assist parents in strengthening character, developing good citizenship, and enhancing physical and mental fitness in youth.

These values will help your son make good decisions throughout his lifetime and give him confidence as he becomes an adult leader of tomorrow.

Scouting provides your son with a positive peer group and a program that is fun and adventurous. It helps him to "be prepared" to shape his own future.

<h2>Cub Scout Motto: "Do Your Best"</h2>
Cut Scouting is a home and neighborhood centered program designed to support family life for boys in the first through fifth grades. Each Cub Scout learns respect for his home, country, God and other people.

The program also helps boys to:

* Develop new skills through sports, crafts and games
* Learn how to get a long with others through group activies
* Build self esteem
