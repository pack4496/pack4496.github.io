In order to strengthen family bonds, the responsibility for some of a boy's advancement in Cub Scouting lies with the family rather than the Pack. Other advancement requirements are done at Den meetings. Recognition takes place at the monthly Pack meetings. All of the Cub Scout ranks are tailored for grade and corresponding age levels.

<h2>Tiger Cubs (1st grade or 7 years old)</h2>
A Cub must complete five achievements from each of these areas: Den activity, family activity and "Go See It" to earn the Tiger rank. After achieving the Tiger Rank, a boy may earn one Tiger Track for every 10 additional electives completed. There is no limit to the number of Tiger Track beads a boy may earn.

<h2>Webelos (4th/5th grades or 10/11 years old)</h2>
When a Cub Scout finishes the 3rd grade, he transfers to a Webelos Den. He then works on requirements for the Webelos rank, 20 activity badges, and the Arrow of Light Award (the highest award in Cub Scouting), which prepares him to transition to Boy Scouts. There are two grade levels in Webelos: Webelos I and Webelos II.
